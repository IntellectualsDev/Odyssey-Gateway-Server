/*
 * The PacketBuffer acts as an interface between the network "gateway" and the slave threads that will process the packets from the "gateway". Now that we have
 *  seperated the Game Server from the Gateway. The gateway will not receive real-time packets, so there is no need for a priority queue
 *  implementation.
 *
 *  Unique_ptr Use:
 *  In this multithreaded context where Packets are being passed between components, ownership becomes obscure, but it is important for memory
 *  deallocation and performance that ownership is known. Thus Packets are referenced to using unique_ptrs which allows for owner transfership
 *  and unique_ptrs automatically handle memory deallocation and also avoids the case where pass by value would be used to stop memory leaks.

 *
 *  //TODO: Performance Considerations:         Currently the buffer accomplishes thread-safe operations using mutexes and locking mechniams, simplifying it to atomic operations would make this more efficeint but that is notoriously difficult
 *
 *
